This learning strategy is based on three key aspects: the role of the teacher, the importance of dialogue, and technological implementations. Classrooms are often structured where the professor plays the role of expert, providing “correct answers” to various questions; however, I understand it as a space where knowledge is acquired but also contested.</p> <h3 id="student-role">student role</h3> <p>While I possess a specialized knowledge of the subject, I recognize that each student brings unique knowledge and perspectives. My goal as an educator is to move beyond passive learning and encourage students to become active learners. This allows us to function as a community of learners engaging with materials and ideas together. I create opportunities for students to share their expertise informally in classroom discussions and more formally in assignments.</p> <h3 id="dialogue-and-dissent">dialogue and dissent</h3> <p>I encourage students to connect their inquiries to their own experiences and worldviews, leading to rich and often surprising classroom discussions. By the end of the semester, students will be more comfortable with textual analysis and confident in their ability to engage with and critique complex ideas. To support this, I present overarching course objectives while allowing students to build their knowledge incrementally. I believe in flexible, negotiable syllabi, where students contribute to shaping the course direction. This approach fosters dissent, making learning a meaningful experience. I strongly advocate a pedagogy of dissent, where students acquire knowledge while developing critical tools to challenge both established scholarly notions and the educator’s assumptions.</p> <h3 id="peer-mentorship">peer mentorship</h3> <p>Dialogue thrives in environments that promote peer mentorship. Cross-pollination of ideas occurs through varied participation methods, including individual interventions, group discussions, blog posts, and virtual annotation of readings. Evaluating participation through multiple formats ensures inclusivity and deeper engagement.</p> <h3 id="technology-integration">technology integration</h3> <p>I incorporate a variety of methods, such as close reading, traditional lectures, seminar group discussions, and digital tools. Digital technologies are key to ensuring that peer mentorship and active learning function effectively. Technology promotes student autonomy, enabling them to take ownership of their learning process. In a truly student-centred classroom, digital tools balance the instructor’s guidance with the student’s role in shaping their learning, creating a dynamic and stimulating environment.</p> <h3 id="digital-tools">digital tools</h3> <h4 id="social-annotation">social annotation</h4> <p><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hypothes.is</a> allows students to annotate texts in real time, fostering interactive dialogue beyond the classroom. This tool is particularly useful for students hesitant to participate in class discussions, providing a space to articulate thoughts in writing and engage with peers about the readings.</p> <h4 id="blog-posting">blog posting</h4> <p>Via Moodle, weekly blog posts serve as a space for students to track their reflections, synthesize thoughts on course materials, and test ideas for final papers. They also enable interaction with classmates and function as an early diagnostic tool to identify areas where students may need additional support.</p> <h2 id="courses-taught">Courses Taught</h2> <p>This is a list of courses that I had been teaching since grad school.</p> <h3 id="pegaso-university-italy">Pegaso University, Italy</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>period</strong>: “April to August 2024”</li> <li> <strong>role</strong>: “Instructor for L-FIL-LET/15 (Germanic Philology)”</li> <li> <strong>course description</strong>: The 54-hour course aimed to familiarize students enrolled in the philosophy programme with the dynamics of the evolution of modern Germanic languages, with a particular focus on English and German.
