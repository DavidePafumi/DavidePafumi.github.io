Essentially, this learning strategy is based on three aspects: the role of the teacher, the importance of dialogue, and technological implementations. Classrooms are quite often constructed by both parties as a place where the professor plays the role of expert, providing the “correct answers” to various questions; however, I understand it as a locus where knowledge is acquired but also contested. Although I am aware that I am coming equipped with a degree and range of knowledge that is different—and perhaps more specifically focused on the subject at hand— than most of my students, each of them certainly brings stores of knowledge that I do not possess. Part of my goal as an educator is to move beyond constructing students as subjects who will passively learn from me to encourage them to become active learners. Like this, we can all be a community of learners engaging with materials and ideas together. To that end, I work to create opportunities for students to share their expertise, both informally in classroom discussions and more formally in assignments. I also encourage them to connect these inquiries to their own experiences and worldviews, which leads—in my experience—to rich, often surprising, classroom discussions. By the end of the semester, students will be more comfortable in textual analysis and more confident in their ability to engage with and critique complex ideas. For this reason, I think that a teacher should present the aim of the course as a whole but convey general ideas through the single classes that the students can use to build up their knowledge. To help students recognise the value of their own insights, they will be provided with the basics of a period, one or more work(s), and an author; they would then be asked to question those same basics. Having flexible and negotiable syllabi is essential for students to be able to contribute to shaping the direction of the course. This level of freedom permits dissent to flourish making learning a meaningful experience. I strongly believe in a pedagogy of dissent, where students are encouraged to acquire knowledge and develop the critical tools needed to challenge both scholars’ well-established notions and the educator’s assumptions. Moved by these premises, I genuinely believe that dialogue can be fostered by an environment in which peer mentorship is encouraged. The cross-pollination given by such an approach is reflected in the need to evaluate participation through various methods: in-class contribution—consisting of individual interventions and group discussions—along with the online ones—represented by blog posting and virtual annotation of the proposed readings. This leads to the last aspect of my approach: digital technologies are key to ensuring that the first two points can function. The purpose of technology, in an educational setting, is to promote students’ autonomy by enabling them to take ownership of their learning process. In a truly student-centred classroom, digital tools can be integrated to balance the instructor’s guidance with the student’s active role in shaping their learning, creating a dynamic, flexible, and effective environment. I incorporate a variety of methods—close reading, traditional lectures, group discussions, and digital tools such as Moodle and <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hypothes.is</a>—to ensure that students can engage with the material in multiple ways. Hypothes.is, in particular, allows students to annotate texts in real time, fostering an interactive dialogue that extends beyond the classroom. This tool is particularly useful for students who may be hesitant to participate in class discussions, as it gives them a space to articulate their thoughts in writing and engage with their peers about the readings. Additionally, weekly blog posts serve as a space for students to keep track of ongoing reflection, synthesise their thoughts on course materials, test ideas for their final papers, and interact with classmates. It is an invaluable exercise to prepare them for the research papers and oral exams—at the same time serving to diagnose eventual problems with the class contents and enabling timely interventions on the part of the teacher.</p> <h2 id="courses-taught">Courses taught</h2> <p>September to December 2025 University of Lethbridge, Canada Teaching Assistant for ENGL-3401 Medieval Literature This course explores the rich literary heritage of the British Isles, examining works originally composed in Old Irish, Old English, Old Spanish, Latin, and Old French.
