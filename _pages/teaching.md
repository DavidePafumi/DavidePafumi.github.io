## Teaching philosophy
teaching_philosophy:
  overview: >
    As both a student and a teacher in medieval and Digital Humanities, my teaching philosophy centres on a student-focused 
    approach that fosters intellectual curiosity, the exchange of ideas, and engagement with diverse perspectives. This learning 
    strategy is based on three key aspects: the role of the teacher, the importance of dialogue, and technological implementations. 
    Classrooms are often structured where the professor plays the role of expert, providing “correct answers” to various questions; 
    however, I understand it as a space where knowledge is acquired but also contested.

  student_role: >
    While I possess a specialized knowledge of the subject, I recognize that each student brings unique knowledge and perspectives. 
    My goal as an educator is to move beyond passive learning and encourage students to become active learners. This allows us to 
    function as a community of learners engaging with materials and ideas together. I create opportunities for students to share 
    their expertise informally in classroom discussions and more formally in assignments.

  dialogue_and_dissent: >
    I encourage students to connect their inquiries to their own experiences and worldviews, leading to rich and often surprising 
    classroom discussions. By the end of the semester, students will be more comfortable with textual analysis and confident in 
    their ability to engage with and critique complex ideas. To support this, I present overarching course objectives while allowing 
    students to build their knowledge incrementally. I believe in flexible, negotiable syllabi, where students contribute to shaping 
    the course direction. This approach fosters dissent, making learning a meaningful experience. I strongly advocate a pedagogy of 
    dissent, where students acquire knowledge while developing critical tools to challenge both established scholarly notions and 
    the educator’s assumptions.

  peer_mentorship: >
    Dialogue thrives in environments that promote peer mentorship. Cross-pollination of ideas occurs through varied participation 
    methods, including individual interventions, group discussions, blog posts, and virtual annotation of readings. Evaluating 
    participation through multiple formats ensures inclusivity and deeper engagement.

  technology_integration: >
    I incorporate a variety of methods, such as close reading, traditional lectures, seminar group discussions, and digital tools. Digital technologies are key to ensuring that peer mentorship and active learning function effectively. Technology promotes 
    student autonomy, enabling them to take ownership of their learning process. In a truly student-centred classroom, digital 
    tools balance the instructor’s guidance with the student’s role in shaping their learning, creating a dynamic and flexible 
    environment.
  digital_tools:
    Hypothes.is: >
      [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) allows students to annotate texts in real time, fostering interactive dialogue beyond the classroom. This tool 
      is particularly useful for students hesitant to participate in class discussions, providing a space to articulate thoughts in 
      writing and engage with peers about the readings.
    blog_posts: >
      Weekly blog posts serve as a space for students to track their reflections, synthesize thoughts on course materials, and test 
      ideas for final papers. They also enable interaction with classmates and function as an early diagnostic tool to identify areas 
      where students may need additional support.
    research_paper_prep: >
      Digital tools and structured reflections prepare students for research papers and oral exams, while also providing insights 
      into class comprehension, allowing for timely pedagogical interventions.
