The Canterbury Tales Project is a pioneering initiative in Digital Humanities, dedicated to the study and preservation of Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. This project aims to develop and publish the most complete scholarly edition of all surviving 84 pre-1501 manuscripts and 4 early printed editions of Chaucer’s work. It replaces less comprehensive print resources used for over half a century and represents the first complete critical edition of a major text created entirely through digital methods.

## Project Scope
As part of this endeavor, the project plans to publish 28 researcher-oriented editions covering the entire Canterbury Tales along with 10 mobile apps presenting commonly-read sections in a format suitable for general readers.

## Achievements

To date, the project has assembled a vast repository of digital images, including 29,000 pages from medieval manuscripts and early printed editions, produced transcripts for approximately 25,000 pages using the Textual Communities softwarem and developed an app for the General Prologue.
